## Operations

### Scalar Multiplication

### Addition and Subtraction

## Dot Product (Inner Product)

## Parallel and Orthogonal Vectors

## Vector Projections

```
v = v" + vT
v" = projv(b) = (v*ub)ub
```

## Cross Products

> Given two linearly independent vectors `a` and `b`, the cross product, `a x b` is a vector that is perpendicular (Orthogonal) to both `a` and `b` and thus normal to the plane containing them...It should not be confused with dot product (projection product).

```
Given:
v = [x1, y1, z1]
w = [x2, y2, z2]
v x w = [y1z2 - y2z1, -(x1z2 - x2z1), x1y2 - x2y1]
```

* Cross Products work with 3d vectors. There is not a higher dimensional generalization.
